https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2019-09/microsoft-releases-18M-building-footprints-in-uganda-and-tanzania-to-enable-ai-assisted-mapping

#### :sparkles: Usability
* The RapiD button is no longer an AI-roads toggle- instead, a dialog opens allowing you to enable Facebook's road layer, Microsoft's building layer, or nothing at all.
